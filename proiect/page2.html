        <p>The Census and Excise is an establishment operated by the Empire in an attempt to manage census counting for
        tax/excise purposes. Imperial taxes are based on head counts of citizens; Census and Excise is responsible for
        both head counts and tax assessment and collection. Census and Excise officers also administer many Imperial
        licenses, e.g. importation, mercenary company incorporation.</p>
    <P>They are typically found in ports across Tamriel, such as <a href="page1.html">Seyda Neen</a> in Vvardenfell.</P>
